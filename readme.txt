COrnerstone folder contains the current theme for H+F.
The folder Stencil_FIles_Consolidated_css contains all the files that I made changes to the original them in order to have the current H+F theme outlook
The Cornerstone-5.0.0.zip contains the actual them that can be uploaded directly to the store. 

NOte: you can only upload a bundled zip theme folder that has been compiled directly from the stencil CLI.  After you upload this zipped theme to the store, it will show up as a regular them, which you can then edit.
